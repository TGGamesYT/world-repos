# World Repo Manager — Easy Minecraft World Sharing & Downloading

World Repo Manager lets Minecraft players and map creators share and discover custom worlds effortlessly through simple online repositories.

How it works:
Map creators upload a small JSON file plus zipped world files to their own website or hosting service. Players add the repository URL inside the mod, then browse, preview, and download the worlds directly from that repo — all without leaving Minecraft.

Features:

- Simple setup for creators: just upload a JSON manifest and zipped worlds to a web folder.

- In-game interface for browsing and downloading worlds from any added repo.

- A curated public repo list where creators can submit their repositories for easy discovery by everyone.

**Perfect for** map makers wanting to share, and players wanting fresh new worlds to explore.

Make sharing and playing custom Minecraft worlds smoother than ever with World Repo Manager!
